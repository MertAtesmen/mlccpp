# Overview

This project is still in its infancy and i am developing this project to learn about machine learning. Currently it only supports linear regression using stochastic gradient descent but i hope i will implement most of the popular machine learning algorithms. There will certainly be computational graphs and neural networks. Maybe i will also add cuda support in the feature.

The project will offer both C and C++ API but the C++ API will probably be faster since the C API is simply a wrapper around C++ API. There is no compatibility issues between C and C++ libraries in my device but some devices might suffer this problems and i dont have any knowladge in this area. 

This project is inspired by the https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm as it offers a C API but uses C++ functionality in the libraries.
